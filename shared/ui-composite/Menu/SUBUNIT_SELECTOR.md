# Subunit Selector

This document explains the second-level navigation that sits below `UnitSelector.tsx` for Kanji and Vocabulary.

## Product rules

- There is no `All` option.
- If a Unit is small enough to stay unsplit, no visible Subunit selector is rendered.
- If a Unit is split, the first Subunit is the default selection.
- All Subunits before the last have the same number of Levels.
- The last Subunit may have fewer Levels, but never more.
- Tiny trailing Subunits are forbidden. The partitioning helper lowers the chunk size until the tail is large enough to feel intentional.

## Why Subunits partition Levels instead of raw items

Every Level already follows the app-wide rule of at most `10` characters or words. That makes Level the natural atomic unit:

- Unit -> contiguous range of Levels
- Subunit -> smaller contiguous range of Levels within one Unit
- Level -> atomic; never split

This keeps Kanji and Vocabulary aligned even though their Unit sizes differ dramatically.

## Data loading and cache behavior

Subunits do **not** change the network layer.

The current architecture still loads one full JLPT Unit JSON at a time:

- Kanji: `/data-kanji/N5.json`, `/data-kanji/N4.json`, ...
- Vocabulary: `/data-vocab/n5.json`, `/data-vocab/n4.json`, ...

Those payloads are cached in:

- module memory
- Zustand-backed `sessionStorage`

Subunits only filter which already-loaded Levels are shown and bulk-selected. Switching Subunits should therefore be instant once the Unit is cached.

## Selection behavior

- Selecting a new Unit clears the current Level selection and switches to the first Subunit of that Unit.
- Selecting a new Subunit also clears the current Level selection so we do not keep invisible selected Levels from another Subunit.
- Quick Select operates only inside the active Subunit.
